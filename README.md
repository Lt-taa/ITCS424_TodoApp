+ Motivation
	Starting to develop the application nowadays was not as challenging as it was in the past. For someone who wishes to begin their programming experience, 
Flutter and Android Studio are a beneficial combination of free learning resources with many examples and projects. 
We chose to create the to-do list application to learn not only fundamental programming but also the UI/UX design that goes along with it.

+ Problem Statement
	More than 80% of the human population have a smartphone of themselves, 
but how many people can remember the tasks that they have to do when the day is almost ending? 
A To-do list is one of the most reliable solutions to solve this problem for someone who doesn't have a decent memory 
whether you want the tasks to be done or memorize the tasks that you did.

+ Objectives of the Project
	To make human life become easier and lighten the userâ€™s burden of remembering their tasks. 
It will help users become more productive and responsible for their tasks, also help boost the memory 
so that users will no longer forget the tasks that they have to do anymore.

+ Scope of the Project
The scope of our project comes from our focus on the current situation. 
Nowadays people live in urgent situations, so if there is a "Todo list Application" it will be a good help to users.

+ Expected Benefits
  - This project will lead us to know how to implement flutter to create many useful applications.
  - This application will help the user organize their task.
  - This application will remind the user about lists that they need to do each day.
  - This application will help users be more productive in their work.
